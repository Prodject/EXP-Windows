# EXP-Windows

This script was beautifully made by MidNightSonne (me), it is supposed to exploit and gain access to Windows computers.

### Prerequisites

These packages are needed to run EXP-Windows, if you don't have them you can install each one yourself or let EXP-Windows do it for you.

```
apache2       - sudo apt-get install apache2
xclip         - sudo apt-get install xclip
xterm         - sudo apt-get install xterm
metasploit    - sudo apt-get install metasploit-framework
xset          - sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
```

### Installing

You can install EXP-Windows with just these commands:

```
cd /folder/where/EXP-Windows/is/located/at/

sudo bash install.sh
```
Also, you can run it with this command "exploitw" directly on console after you have installed it.

### You Can Edit The Script Yourself

There's one argument that you can edit yourself for better use of the EXP-Windows script...

```
# - Update The Latest Packages - Default value "yes"
UpdatePackages=yes

# - Update Script Or ".config" To The Latest Version On GitHub - Default value "yes"
UpdateScript=yes
```
Each one has a very specific task on EXP-Windows, so don't leave them with nothing on.
